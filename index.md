Hello.

I am a DPhil student in the Computational Cardiovascular Science Group at the University of Oxford, supervised by Blanca Rodriguez and Nando de Freitas. My research uses computational techniques such as machine learning and multiscale modelling to extract information from cardiovascular data.

Previously I was an MSc student at the University of Edinburgh supervised by Chris Williams, an MBBS student at King's College London, and a BSc student at the University of Birmingham supervised by Jeremy Wyatt. I was an intern researcher in the Prosecco group at INRIA in 2013, supervised by Ben Smyth.

I have worked in industry as a Lead Software Engineer at a bank and at VideoLAN, Technical Director for a security company in Dubai and System Management Specialist for a healthcare IT company.
