Hello.

I am interested in extracting information from healthcare data using computational techniques such as machine learning and multiscale modelling, to improve patient care.

I'm currently a Director at the [MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science](https://ccds.io/), where I was previously a Visiting Scientist.
