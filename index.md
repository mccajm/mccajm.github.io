Hello.

I am interested in extracting information from healthcare data using computational techniques such as machine learning and multiscale modelling, to improve patient care.

I'm currently EMEA Lead - Healthcare and Life Sciences Startups at AWS and a Voting Member at HL7. Previously I was a Director at the [MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science](https://ccds.io/).
