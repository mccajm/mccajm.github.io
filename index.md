Hello.

I am a DPhil student in the Computational Cardiovascular Science Group at the University of Oxford, supervised by Blanca Rodriguez and Nando de Freitas. My research uses computational techniques such as machine learning and multiscale modelling to extract information from cardiovascular data. Previously I was an MSc student at the University of Edinburgh supervised by Chris Williams, an MBBS student at King's College London and a BSc student at the University of Birmingham, supervised by Jeremy Wyatt.
